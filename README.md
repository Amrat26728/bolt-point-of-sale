# Bolt Point of Sale
A point-of-sale application built for the ease of businesses.

Some constraint to check before making any edit:
1. Your new layout (if added any) must be of 800x600 size.
2. It must match the color palette used throughout.
3. Do not COMMIT directly even if you have authority. Just fork, edit and pull request so everyone can review it and then merged.
4. Check issues, check requirements and then act.

Thanks for your contributions.
